# About Beagle: #

The Beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. 
The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare, known as beagling. 
Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, 
the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. 
The beagle is intelligent and is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.
